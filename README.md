# Hand of Doom

A text-based adaptation of the [Dungeon Degenerates: Hand of Doom](https://goblinkomegamall.com/collections/dungeon-degenerates)
board game by Goblinko. Currently, the only things you can do are move around the map and rest.

Execute 'run' to start. Delete 'savefile.yaml' to reset the game.

When in the game, type 'help' (or 'h') to list all available commands or 'quit' (or 'q') to quit. Other useful commands
are 'look' (or 'l') to look around, 'info' (or 'i') to show character info, and the compass directions to travel in that
direction.
